Travel Script, written in Coffee Script

Purpose of script:
. to screen scrape flight page, produce e-mail friendly page
. to add hotel bookings, according to info in google spreadsheet
. to add car bookings and travel times
. to export relevant info to a different google spreadsheet

Notes for dev, when running the following commands under the project root directory:
. 'rake' by default will run minify_js and produce TravelHelper.min.js
. 'rake jasmine' will run jasmine server for testing
. 'guard' is set up to compile .coffee files to .js
